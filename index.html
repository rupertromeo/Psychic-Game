	<!-- 

		This is the pseudocode used to prepare for development of the Psychic Game

		Game Objective:
		User is given 9 guesses to correctly select which random letter the app has chosen.

		Steps the app should use for the game to properly function:
		1) App randomly chooses a letter
		2) User guesses a letter by typing one in
		3) A: If the User guess matches the app's choice, the user is given a win in the win column and the app moves on to step 4.
		   B: If the User guess is wrong and does NOT match the app's guess, the user is given a loss in the loss column, their guess is logged to the guesses so far area, the guesses remaining section is updated to reflect the number of guesses left and the app returns to step 2 until the user correctly guesses the letter or runs out of their remaining guesses.
		4)	Game Reset: User Guesses = 9, Clear user guesses and Return to Step 1
